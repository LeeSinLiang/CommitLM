# Documentation: Improved Naming for Auto-Generated Commit Docs

## 1. Summary

This update enhances the file naming convention for automatically generated commit documentation. The previous timestamp-based filenames have been replaced with a more descriptive, human-readable format derived directly from the commit message. This change significantly improves the discoverability and organization of documentation files.

## 2. Changes

The core modification is within the git hook script responsible for generating documentation filenames.

### Deprecated Logic
- The previous method generated filenames using a combination of the short commit hash and a timestamp.
- **Format:** `docs/commit_<short-hash>_<timestamp>.md`

### New Logic
- A new sanitization process has been introduced to create a "slug" from the commit message.
- The new filename format is `docs/commit_<sanitized-message>_<short-hash>.md`.

The sanitization process involves the following steps:
1.  **Convert to Lowercase**: The entire commit message is converted to lowercase.
2.  **Character Removal**: All special characters are removed, preserving only alphanumeric characters, spaces, and hyphens.
3.  **Hyphenation**: All spaces are replaced with hyphens, and multiple consecutive hyphens are collapsed into a single one.
4.  **Truncation**: The resulting string is truncated to a maximum of 50 characters to prevent overly long filenames.
5.  **Cleanup**: Any trailing hyphens are removed.
6.  **Fallback**: If the sanitization process results in an empty string, the filename will use `unnamed` as a fallback.

## 3. Impact

-   **Enhanced Readability**: Filenames are now self-descriptive, allowing developers to understand the content of a documentation file at a glance without opening it.
-   **Improved Discoverability**: Searching for documentation related to a specific feature or fix is now much easier using standard file system search tools.
-   **Consistent Naming**: The robust sanitization process ensures that all generated filenames are safe, consistent, and free of problematic characters.

## 4. Usage Example

This change is applied automatically by the git hook; no user action is required. The following example illustrates the difference in generated filenames for the same commit.

**Commit Message:** `Feat: Add multi-factor authentication (MFA)!`
**Short Hash:** `a1b2c3d`

#### Before:
The generated filename would be based on the timestamp, making it non-descriptive.
```
docs/commit_a1b2c3d_20231027_103000.md
```

#### After:
The new filename is descriptive and derived from the commit message.
```
docs/commit_feat-add-multi-factor-authentication-mfa_a1b2c3d.md
```

## 5. Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes to the API or the core functionality of the documentation generator. However, this update changes a fundamental naming convention. Any external scripts or tooling that rely on the old `..._<hash>_<timestamp>.md` filename format will need to be updated to accommodate the new structure.

## 6. Migration Notes

-   **Existing Files**: No action is required for previously generated documentation. These files will retain their original timestamp-based names.
-   **Custom Scripts**: If you have custom scripts that parse or link to these documentation files, you must update their logic to match the new `docs/commit_<sanitized-message>_<short-hash>.md` format.

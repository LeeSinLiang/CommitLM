# Documentation Update: Project Metadata and Version Bump

## 1. Summary

This update to the `pyproject.toml` file for the `CommitLM` project signifies a major milestone. The project version has been advanced from `0.1.0` to `1.0.0`, indicating a stable and production-ready release. Concurrently, the placeholder author information has been updated with official details.

## 2. Changes

The following modifications have been applied to the `pyproject.toml` configuration:

*   **Project Version Update**:
    *   The `version` field under the `[project]` section has been incremented from `0.1.0` to `1.0.0`. This is a major version bump, typically denoting significant stability or feature completion.
    ```diff
    -version = "0.1.0"
    +version = "1.0.0"
    ```
*   **Author Information Finalization**:
    *   The `authors` field has been updated to reflect the official author's name and email, replacing generic placeholder information.
    ```diff
    -authors = [{name = "Your Name", email = "your.email@example.com"}]
    +authors = [{name = "Sin Liang Lee", email = "sinlianglee@outlook.com"}]
    ```

## 3. Impact

*   **Project Stability and Maturity**: The transition to version `1.0.0` indicates that `CommitLM` is now considered stable, mature, and ready for general use in production environments. This typically implies that core features are complete, thoroughly tested, and the API is stable.
*   **Accurate Metadata**: The updated author information ensures proper attribution and provides correct contact details for the project maintainer, improving project discoverability and trustworthiness.
*   **Dependency Management**: Users and downstream projects should now reference `CommitLM` at version `1.0.0` or higher to benefit from the latest stable release.

## 4. Usage

These changes are primarily metadata updates and do not introduce new features or modify existing functionality directly through this diff. To utilize the latest stable version of `CommitLM`, ensure your project dependencies are updated accordingly.

**Example `pyproject.toml` dependency:**
```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "CommitLM==1.0.0",
    # ... other dependencies
]
```

**Example `requirements.txt` dependency:**
```
CommitLM==1.0.0
```

## 5. Breaking Changes

**This specific diff, which only modifies `pyproject.toml` metadata, does not introduce any breaking changes.**

However, a major version increment from `0.x.x` to `1.0.0` in semantic versioning *conventionally* signals that there *may* be backward-incompatible changes in the overall release associated with this version. Developers are strongly advised to review the full release notes for `CommitLM 1.0.0` to understand any potential API changes, deprecations, or migration requirements that are not visible in this metadata-only diff.

## 6. Migration Notes

No specific migration steps are required for these `pyproject.toml` metadata changes. Users should simply update their project's dependency on `CommitLM` to `1.0.0` to benefit from the stable release and any associated improvements or new features introduced in the `1.0.0` release.

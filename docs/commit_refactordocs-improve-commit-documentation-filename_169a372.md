### **Release Notes: CommitLM v1.0.0 - AI-Native Git Assistant**

This major release introduces significant new features and enhancements, transforming CommitLM into a comprehensive AI-native Git assistant. The update adds automated conventional commit message generation, multi-provider LLM support, and a more intuitive file naming system for generated documentation.

---

### **1. Summary**

Version 1.0.0 expands CommitLM's core functionality beyond documentation generation to include automated commit message creation. It introduces a flexible, multi-provider architecture, allowing users to select different LLMs (cloud or local) for different tasks. The CLI has been overhauled for a more interactive and robust user experience. Additionally, the naming convention for generated documentation files has been updated to be more descriptive and human-readable, using the commit message instead of a timestamp.

### **2. Changes**

#### **Major Feature: Automated Commit Message Generation & Multi-Provider Support**

*   **Automated Commit Messages**: A new `prepare-commit-msg` Git hook automatically generates a conventional commit message from staged changes, pre-filling the commit editor for review.
*   **Multi-Provider LLM Architecture**: Users can now configure and use LLMs from multiple providers:
    *   Cloud: OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude
    *   Local: HuggingFace models
*   **Task-Specific Model Configuration**: Configure different models for different tasks. For example, use a fast local model for commit messages and a powerful cloud model for in-depth documentation.
*   **CLI Overhaul**:
    *   **Interactive Setup**: The `commitlm init` command now uses interactive prompts for easier configuration.
    *   **Enhanced Validation**: `commitlm validate` performs live generation tests for all configured tasks to ensure the setup is working end-to-end.
    *   **Detailed Status**: `commitlm status` provides a clear view of the global default model and any task-specific overrides.
    *   **Convenience Alias**: A `commitlm set-alias` command creates a `git c` alias for a streamlined stage-and-commit workflow.
*   **Improved Reliability**: Hook output is now redirected to `stderr` to prevent it from polluting commit messages, and API error handling has been improved.

#### **Refactor: Descriptive Documentation Filenames**

The naming convention for generated documentation files has been updated to improve readability and discoverability.

*   **Previous Format**: `docs/commit_<SHORT_HASH>_<TIMESTAMP>.md`
    *   Example: `docs/commit_a1b2c3d_20231027_103000.md`
*   **New Format**: `docs/commit_<SANITIZED_MESSAGE>_<SHORT_HASH>.md`
    *   The commit message is sanitized (lowercased, special characters removed, spaces hyphenated, and truncated) to create a URL-friendly slug.
    *   Example: `docs/commit_feat-add-new-login-button_a1b2c3d.md`

### **3. Impact**

*   **Accelerated Workflow**: Automating commit message and documentation generation significantly reduces manual effort and enforces repository consistency.
*   **Unprecedented Flexibility**: Developers can tailor their AI tooling, balancing performance, cost, and privacy by choosing the right model for each task.
*   **Enhanced Discoverability**: The new documentation filenames make it easy to find relevant information directly from the file system.
*   **Improved User Confidence**: The enhanced `validate` and `status` commands provide clear insight into the system's configuration and operational readiness.

---

### **4. Usage**

**1. Re-initialize Your Configuration**
Run the interactive setup to configure providers and task-specific models.
```bash
commitlm init
```
*(Remember to set API keys like `OPENAI_API_KEY` as environment variables if using cloud providers.)*

**2. Install/Update Git Hooks**
Ensure both the new commit message hook and the documentation hook are installed.
```bash
commitlm install-hook
```

**3. Verify Your Setup**
Use the new commands to confirm your configuration is correct and functional.
```bash
commitlm status
commitlm validate
```

**4. Streamlined Commit Workflow**
Set up and use the new alias for a seamless process.
```bash
# One-time alias setup
commitlm set-alias

# New workflow
git add .
git c # Stages changes and opens editor with a generated commit message
```

---

### **5. Breaking Changes**

*   **Configuration Schema**: The `.commitlm-config.json` file format has been significantly updated to support the new multi-provider, task-specific settings. Old configuration files are not compatible.
*   **Documentation Filename Format**: Any external scripts or tools that relied on the previous `commit_<HASH>_<TIMESTAMP>.md` filename format will need to be updated to handle the new `commit_<SANITIZED_MESSAGE>_<HASH>.md` structure.

---

### **6. Migration Notes**

*   **Re-initialize**: It is **highly recommended** to run `commitlm init` to generate a new, compatible configuration file.
*   **Re-install Hooks**: Run `commitlm install-hook` to install the new `prepare-commit-msg` hook.
*   **Update Scripts**: Review any custom tooling that interacts with the `docs/` directory and update it to match the new filename convention. Existing documentation files will not be renamed.

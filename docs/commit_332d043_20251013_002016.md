## Technical Documentation: CLI Interaction & Dependency Update

### 1. Summary

This update primarily focuses on enhancing the Command Line Interface (CLI) user experience by migrating interactive prompts from `click.prompt` and `click.confirm` to the more robust and user-friendly `InquirerPy` library. This change provides richer, list-based selections and clearer confirmations for various configuration and setup commands. Additionally, the `.gitignore` file has been cleaned up for better project hygiene.

### 2. Changes

*   **CLI Interaction Overhaul**: All interactive prompts within `commitlm/cli/commands.py` (e.g., `change_model`, `enable_task`, Git hook installation/uninstallation, `set_alias`) and `commitlm/cli/init_command.py` (initial setup, task-specific model configuration) have been refactored. They now utilize `InquirerPy.prompt` for a more guided and interactive experience, replacing simple text-based `click` prompts with list selections, input fields, and clearer confirmations. The `qmark: ""` option has been applied to many prompts for a cleaner visual.
*   **Dependency Update**: The `InquirerPy` library has been added as a core dependency in `pyproject.toml` and its casing corrected in `requirements.txt` to ensure proper installation.
*   **`.gitignore` Cleanup**: Several temporary or specific documentation-related files (`docs/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.mcp.json`, `GEMINI.md`) have been removed from `.gitignore`, streamlining the ignored file list.

### 3. Impact

*   **Enhanced User Experience**: Users will now encounter significantly more intuitive and interactive prompts when configuring CommitLM, selecting LLM providers/models, enabling tasks, or managing Git hooks. This improves clarity, reduces potential input errors, and makes the CLI more pleasant to use.
*   **New Dependency**: The project now relies on `InquirerPy` for its interactive CLI components. This will be automatically handled during installation or updates.
*   **Codebase Readability**: The internal CLI code for defining prompts is now more structured, explicitly defining question types, choices, and default values, which can improve maintainability for developers.

### 4. Usage

The core commands and their arguments remain unchanged. However, the *interaction* with these commands has been significantly improved.

**Example: Configuring the default model (`commitlm config model default`)**

*   **Before (with `click.prompt`)**:
    ```
    Select LLM provider [huggingface]:
    Enter the model name [qwen2.5-coder-1.5b]:
    ```
*   **After (with `InquirerPy.prompt`)**:
    You will see an interactive list of choices that you can navigate with arrow keys, and input fields for text:
    ```
    Select LLM provider:
    ‚ùØ huggingface
      gemini
      anthropic
      openai

    Enter the model name:
    (Your current default model will be pre-filled)
    ```
Similarly, confirmation prompts (e.g., overwriting a configuration file or Git hook) will now present an interactive "Yes"/"No" list.

### 5. Breaking Changes

None. This update primarily affects the interactive user interface of the CLI and does not introduce any changes to command-line arguments or core functionality that would break existing scripts or workflows.

### 6. Migration Notes

No specific migration steps are required for end-users. The changes will be automatically applied upon updating the CommitLM package. Developers working on the CLI should adopt `InquirerPy` for new interactive prompts to maintain consistency.

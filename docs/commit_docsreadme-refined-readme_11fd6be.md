# Documentation: README.md Cleanup

This document provides a detailed analysis of the recent changes to the project's `README.md` file.

### 1. Summary

This update involves a minor cosmetic change to the `README.md` file, where a personal attribution line has been removed from the footer. The purpose of this change is to streamline the documentation and present a more project-centric, rather than individual-centric, appearance.

### 2. Changes

- **File Modified:** `README.md`
- **Deletion:** The following line has been removed from the end of the file:
  ```diff
  -**Made with ❤️ by [Sin Liang Lee](https://github.com/LeeSinLiang)**
  ```

This line, which previously credited an individual contributor, was located between the legal notice link and the call-to-action to star the repository on GitHub.

### 3. Impact

- **No Functional Impact:** This is a documentation-only change and has no effect on the codebase, application functionality, or performance.
- **Documentation Appearance:** The `README.md` footer is now slightly more concise. The removal of the personal credit line shifts the focus to the project as a collective effort.

### 5. Breaking Changes

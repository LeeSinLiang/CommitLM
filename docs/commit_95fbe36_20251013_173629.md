### **CommitLM Version 1.0.0: AI-Native Git Workflow Automation**

This major `1.0.0` release transforms CommitLM into a comprehensive AI-native Git assistant. The core functionality has been expanded to include automated conventional commit message generation, complementing the existing documentation feature. This is powered by a new multi-provider architecture, allowing users to leverage powerful cloud LLMs (Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT) or local models, with the flexibility to assign different models to different tasks. The entire CLI has been enhanced for a more intuitive and robust user experience.

---

### **Changes**

#### 1. **Core Functionality Expansion**
*   **Automated Commit Message Generation**: A new `prepare-commit-msg` Git hook automatically generates a conventional commit message based on staged changes, pre-filling the commit editor.
*   **Multi-Provider LLM Support**: Users can now choose between local HuggingFace models and cloud APIs from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.
*   **Task-Specific Model Configuration**: It is now possible to configure different LLM providers and models for specific tasks (e.g., use a fast model for commit messages and a powerful model for documentation).

#### 2. **CLI & User Experience Overhaul**
*   **Interactive Prompts**: The CLI now uses `InquirerPy` for a modern, interactive experience during setup (`init`) and configuration, replacing simple text prompts with navigable lists.
*   **Enhanced Status Command**: `commitlm status` now provides a granular view, displaying the global default model as well as any task-specific models configured for commit messages or documentation.
*   **Robust Validation**: The `commitlm validate` command now performs live generation tests for both commit message and documentation tasks, confirming the entire configuration is functional end-to-end.
*   **Streamlined Commit Alias**: A new `commitlm set-alias` command creates a convenient `git c` alias for a one-command workflow (stage, generate message, and commit).

#### 3. **Improved Robustness & Reliability**
*   **Git Hook Output Redirection**: Informational logs during hook execution (e.g., "Generating commit message...") are now sent to `stderr`, preventing them from being accidentally included in the commit message itself.
*   **Enhanced Error Handling**: API clients now provide clearer error messages for invalid API keys and handle unexpected `None` responses gracefully.

---

### **Impact**

*   **Streamlined Developer Workflow**: The combination of automated commit messages and documentation generation significantly reduces manual effort and enforces consistency.
*   **Unprecedented Flexibility**: Developers can now tailor their setup, choosing between powerful cloud APIs for performance or local models for privacy and cost-effectiveness on a per-task basis.
*   **Improved Configuration Transparency**: Enhanced `status` and `validate` commands make it easy to understand and debug the active configuration, ensuring the right models are used for the right tasks.

---

### **Usage**

**1. Initialize or Re-configure Your Setup**
Run the interactive setup to configure providers, models, and tasks.
```bash
commitlm init
```
*Remember to set API keys as environment variables (e.g., `export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"`) if using cloud providers.*

**2. Install Hooks**
Install both the commit message and documentation hooks for the full experience.
```bash
commitlm install-hook
```

**3. Check Your Configuration**
Verify your setup with the enhanced `status` and `validate` commands.
```bash
commitlm status
commitlm validate
```

**4. Use the Automated Workflow**
Use the new alias for a seamless commit process.
```bash
# One-time setup for the alias
commitlm set-alias

# Standard workflow
git add .
git c # Stages, generates message, and opens editor for review
```

---

### **Breaking Changes**

*   **Configuration File Format**: The `.commitlm-config.json` schema has been significantly updated to support multi-provider and task-specific settings. Old configuration files are not fully compatible with the new features.
*   **Project Version**: The project has been bumped to `1.0.0`, signaling a stable but potentially backward-incompatible release compared to the `0.x` series.

### **Migration Notes**

*   **Re-initialize Configuration**: It is **highly recommended** to run `commitlm init` again. This will guide you through the new options and update your configuration file to the latest format.
*   **Re-install Git Hooks**: To enable automated commit message generation, run `commitlm install-hook` to install the new `prepare-commit-msg` hook alongside the existing `post-commit` hook.
*   **Set API Keys**: If migrating to cloud-based models, ensure the corresponding API key environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, etc.) are set in your shell profile.

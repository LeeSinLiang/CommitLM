### **Documentation Update: Comprehensive README.md Overhaul**

This update significantly enhances the project's `README.md` to provide a more professional, comprehensive, and user-friendly experience for developers. The changes improve navigation, clarify the tool's value, and encourage community contribution.

---

### 1. Summary

The `README.md` has been overhauled to function as a complete portal for the project. Key additions include a table of contents, project status badges, concrete usage examples, and dedicated sections for contributing, licensing, and support. This documentation-only change aims to improve clarity, usability, and project presentation without altering any code functionality.

### 2. Detailed Changes

-   **Project Badges:** Added PyPI version, supported Python versions, and Apache 2.0 license badges to the top of the README for at-a-glance project status.
-   **"Why CommitLM?" Section:** A new introductory section was added to quickly communicate the core benefits of the tool, such as time savings, quality assurance, and AI flexibility.
-   **Table of Contents:** A comprehensive Table of Contents has been implemented to allow for easy navigation of the now much larger document.
-   **Concrete Examples:** The "Usage Examples" section has been enriched with sample outputs for both a generated commit message and a generated documentation file, clearly demonstrating the tool's capabilities.
-   **API Key Guidance:** Added direct links to the official provider pages for obtaining API keys (Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI), streamlining the setup process.
-   **Expanded Troubleshooting:** The troubleshooting section now includes guidance for two common issues:
    -   Resolving conflicts with existing Git hooks.
    -   Troubleshooting "Configuration Not Found" errors.
-   **New Sections Added:**
    -   **Contributing:** A comprehensive guide for contributors, detailing how to report issues, request features, set up a development environment, and submit pull requests.
    -   **License:** A clear summary of the Apache 2.0 license, outlining permissions and conditions for use.
    -   **Support:** A dedicated section with links to GitHub Issues, Discussions, and the project's PyPI page.

### 3. Impact

-   **Improved Developer Experience:** The enhanced structure and content make it significantly easier for new users to understand, install, configure, and use the tool.
-   **Enhanced Project Professionalism:** The addition of badges, a clear license, and contribution guidelines presents the project as more mature and well-maintained.
-   **Encourages Community Engagement:** The new "Contributing" section provides a clear pathway for developers to get involved, report bugs, and contribute code, fostering a healthier open-source community.

### 4. Usage

The core functionality of the tool remains unchanged. However, the README now provides clearer examples of its output.

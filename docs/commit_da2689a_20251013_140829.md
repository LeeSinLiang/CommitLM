---

This documentation outlines recent enhancements and structural improvements to the CommitLM project, focusing on increased configuration flexibility, updated LLM model support, and improved robustness.

---

### **1. Summary: Enhanced Configuration and Robustness**

This update primarily introduces granular control over LLM configurations for specific tasks (e.g., commit message generation vs. documentation generation), updates default LLM models, and significantly improves error handling across various LLM clients. Minor code structure refinements and standardization of file endings also contribute to overall project health and maintainability.

### **2. Changes: Detailed Modifications**

*   **Task-Specific LLM Configuration**:
    *   A new `TaskSettings` Pydantic model has been introduced, allowing users to define `provider` and `model` overrides for `commit_message` and `doc_generation` tasks independently.
    *   The `Settings` class now includes `commit_message: Optional[TaskSettings]` and `doc_generation: Optional[TaskSettings]` fields.
    *   The `LLMClientFactory.create_client` method now correctly leverages these task-specific settings.
*   **LLM Model Updates**:
    *   The default OpenAI model in `OpenAIConfig` has been updated from `gpt-4o-mini` to `gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07`.
    *   The `qwen2.5-coder-1.5b` model has been removed from the `HuggingFaceModel` `Literal` type, indicating a potential shift in supported HuggingFace models.
    *   The `CPU_MODEL_CONFIGS` dictionary has been removed from `settings.py`, suggesting a refactored approach to CPU model configuration or detection.
*   **Improved Error Handling & Robustness**:
    *   **API Key Validation**: Enhanced error messages for invalid API keys in Gemini, Anthropic, and OpenAI clients, providing clearer guidance to the user.
    *   **Gemini `None` Response Handling**: Added explicit checks for `None` responses from the Gemini API, attempting to retrieve content from candidates or falling back gracefully.
    *   **Optional Dependency Checks**: `bitsandbytes` and `flash_attn` imports in `HuggingFaceClient` now use `importlib.util.find_spec` for more robust checks, preventing crashes if these optional dependencies are not installed.
    *   **Configuration Key Setting**: The `config_set` CLI command now includes error handling for non-existent configuration keys.
*   **Code Structure & Imports**:
    *   Removed unused `json` import from `commitlm/cli/commands.py`.
    *   Moved several imports (e.g., `subprocess`, `os`, `shutil`, `tempfile`) into their respective function scopes to reduce global namespace pollution and improve modularity.
    *   Added `_prompt_for_task_model` imports within `enable_task` and `init_command` to resolve potential circular dependencies.
*   **File Ending Standardization**: Removed `\ No newline at end of file` markers across various Python files, standardizing file endings.

### **3. Impact: Enhanced User Experience and Maintainability**

These changes significantly improve the flexibility and reliability of CommitLM:

*   **Greater Customization**: Users can now fine-tune LLM providers and models for different tasks, optimizing for cost, performance, or specific model capabilities without affecting other tasks.
*   **Increased Stability**: Robust error handling for API keys and LLM responses reduces unexpected failures and provides clearer feedback.
*   **Smoother Setup**: Better dependency checks mean the tool is more resilient to missing optional packages, leading to a smoother initial setup experience.
*   **Improved Code Quality**: Refactored imports and standardized file endings contribute to a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.

### **4. Usage: Configuring Task-Specific Models**

You can now configure different models for commit message generation and documentation generation.

**Example: Setting a specific model for commit messages**

To set the `commit_message` task to use `gpt-4o-mini` from OpenAI, you can use the `config change-model` command:

```bash
commitlm config change-model commit_message
# Follow the interactive prompts to select 'openai' as provider and 'gpt-4o-mini' as model.
```

Alternatively, you can manually edit your `.commitlm-config.json` file:

```json
{
  "provider": "huggingface",
  "model": "phi-3-mini-128k",
  "commit_message_enabled": true,
  "doc_generation_enabled": false,
  "commit_message": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini"
  },
  "doc_generation": null
}
```

### **5. Breaking Changes**

*   **HuggingFace `qwen2.5-coder-1.5b` Model**: If you were explicitly configuring `qwen2.5-coder-1.5b` as a HuggingFace model, its removal from the `HuggingFaceModel` `Literal` type might cause configuration validation issues.
*   **`CPU_MODEL_CONFIGS` Removal**: Direct reliance on `CPU_MODEL_CONFIGS` for configuring local CPU models is no longer supported. The underlying mechanism for CPU model handling has been refactored.

### **6. Migration Notes**

1.  **Review Configurations**: After updating, please review your `.commitlm-config.json` file.
    *   If you were using `qwen2.5-coder-1.5b`, you might need to select an alternative HuggingFace model or adjust your configuration.
    *   If you had specific CPU model configurations, verify that CommitLM still correctly identifies and uses your desired local models. The `status` command can help confirm active models.
2.  **API Keys**: If you encounter `LLMClientError` related to API keys, ensure your keys are correctly configured and valid by running `commitlm init` or updating your `.commitlm-config.json`.
3.  **Default OpenAI Model**: Be aware that the default OpenAI model for new configurations or if not explicitly set has changed to `gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07`. If you prefer a different OpenAI model, configure it using `commitlm config change-model default` or `commitlm config set openai.model <your-model>`.

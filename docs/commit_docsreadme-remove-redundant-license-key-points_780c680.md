### **Documentation Update: README.md Cleanup**

This document details a minor refinement to the project's `README.md` file.

### 1. Summary

This update streamlines the "License" section of the `README.md` file by removing a redundant, summarized list of key points from the Apache 2.0 license. The change aims to simplify the documentation and direct users to the official `LICENSE` file as the single, authoritative source for licensing information.

### 2. Changes

**File Modified:** `README.md`

- **Deletion:** The "Key Points" subsection under the main "License" heading has been removed.

The following content was deleted:
```markdown
### Key Points
- ✅ Free for commercial and personal use
- ✅ Modify and distribute freely
- ✅ Patent protection included
- ℹ️ Must include copyright notice and license in distributions
- ℹ️ Must state significant changes made to the code
```

**Rationale:**
Summarizing legal terms can be imprecise and may lead to misinterpretation. By removing this summary, we encourage developers and users to consult the full `LICENSE` file, which is the standard best practice for understanding their rights and obligations. This also reduces the maintenance burden of keeping the summary in sync with the official license text.

### 3. Impact

- This is a **documentation-only change** and has no effect on the project's code, functionality, or build process.
- The project's license **remains Apache License 2.0**. This change does not alter the licensing terms in any way.
- The `README.md` is now more concise, pointing directly to the canonical `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` files for all legal details.

### 4. Usage

There are no changes to software usage or functionality.

### 5. Breaking Changes

None. This is a non-code, documentation update.

### 6. Migration Notes

No migration or user action is required.

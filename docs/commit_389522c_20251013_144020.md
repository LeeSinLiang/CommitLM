# Documentation Update: Enhanced `status` Command Output

This document details the recent improvements to the `commitlm` CLI's `status` command, providing users with a clearer overview of configured Language Model (LLM) settings.

## 1. Summary

The `status` command has been enhanced to provide a more granular view of the active LLM configurations. Previously, it only displayed a single "Active Model." Now, it distinguishes between the global "Default Model" and any task-specific models configured for features like commit message generation and documentation generation, offering greater transparency into which models are being utilized by different `commitlm` functionalities.

## 2. Changes

*   **Renamed "Active Model" to "Default Model":** The output label for the globally configured LLM model has been updated for clarity.
*   **Introduced Task-Specific Model Display:**
    *   If `commit_message_enabled` is true and `commit_message` settings are present, the `status` command will now display the "Commit Message Model." This includes its specific provider and model if configured, otherwise falling back to the global default.
    *   Similarly, if `doc_generation_enabled` is true and `doc_generation` settings are present, the "Documentation Model" will be shown, reflecting its specific or default LLM configuration.

## 3. Impact

*   **Improved Visibility:** Users can now easily ascertain which LLM provider and model are active for the global default, as well as for specific features like commit message and documentation generation. This is particularly useful when different models are configured for different tasks.
*   **Enhanced Debugging:** The detailed status output aids in diagnosing configuration issues or verifying that the intended models are being used for each `commitlm` operation.
*   **No Functional Changes:** These modifications are purely to the informational output of the `status` command; the underlying LLM interaction logic remains unchanged.

## 4. Usage

To see the updated status output, simply run the `commitlm status` command in your terminal:

```bash
commitlm status
```

**Example Output (with task-specific models configured):**

```
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 Status Table
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 Feature              Status Details
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 LLM Provider         ✅      openai
 Default Model        ✅      gpt-3.5-turbo
 Commit Message Model ✅      openai/gpt-4o
 Documentation Model  ✅      anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

To configure task-specific models, you would typically use your `commitlm.toml` configuration file:

```toml
# commitlm.toml
[commit_message]
enabled = true
model = "gpt-4o"
provider = "openai" # Optional, defaults to global provider if not specified

[doc_generation]
enabled = true
model = "claude-3-opus-20240229"
provider = "anthropic" # Optional, defaults to global provider if not specified
```

## 5. Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes associated with this update. The `status` command will continue to function as before, with additional information provided.

## 6. Migration Notes

No migration steps are required. Existing `commitlm` installations will automatically display the enhanced status output upon updating to the version containing these changes. Users with existing task-specific configurations will simply observe the new details in their `status` report.

### **Release Notes: Project Licensing, Packaging, and Dependency Updates**

This update formalizes the project's open-source status by introducing the Apache 2.0 license. It also includes significant enhancements to the Python packaging configuration for professional distribution and cleans up project dependencies.

---

### **1. Summary**

The project has been updated to include a formal open-source license (Apache 2.0), making its terms of use clear for developers and contributors. The `pyproject.toml` file has been significantly enhanced with comprehensive metadata to prepare the package for publication on PyPI. Additionally, the project's dependencies have been refined by removing the unused `pygithub` library and adding `google-api-core`.

---

### **2. Changes**

#### **Licensing and Legal**

*   **Added `LICENSE` file**: The project is now officially licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**.
*   **Added `NOTICE` file**: This file includes copyright information and acknowledges the third-party libraries used in the project, along with their respective licenses.
*   **Updated `pyproject.toml`**: The `license` field has been set to `Apache-2.0`.

#### **Python Packaging (`pyproject.toml`)**

*   **Package Name**: Standardized the package name to `commitlm` for PyPI compatibility.
*   **Metadata**: Added comprehensive metadata to improve discoverability and provide useful information on PyPI:
    *   `version` bumped to `1.0.5`.
    *   Added `keywords` for better searchability.
    *   Included detailed `classifiers` to categorize the project.
    *   Added `project.urls` linking to the Homepage, Repository, and Issue tracker.
*   **Development Dependencies**: Introduced an optional `[dev]` dependency group for development and testing tools like `pytest`, `black`, and `ruff`.

#### **Dependency Management**

*   **Removed `pygithub`**: The `pygithub` library has been removed from both `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` as it is no longer a required dependency.
*   **Added `google-api-core`**: This library was added as a necessary dependency for the Google Generative AI provider.

#### **Documentation**

*   **Example Added**: A new documentation file, `docs/commit_refactordocs-improve-commit-documentation-filename_169a372.md`, has been added. This file serves as an example of the tool's output and showcases a new, more descriptive filename format: `commit_<SANITIZED_MESSAGE>_<SHORT_HASH>.md`.

---

### **3. Impact**

*   **Clear Legal Standing**: The adoption of the Apache 2.0 license provides clear guidelines for usage, modification, and distribution, encouraging community adoption and contributions.
*   **Improved Discoverability**: The enhanced packaging metadata will make the `commitlm` package easier to find and understand for developers browsing PyPI.
*   **Streamlined Development**: The new `[dev]` dependency group simplifies the setup process for new contributors.
*   **Reduced Footprint**: Removing the unused `pygithub` dependency makes the project lighter and reduces its attack surface.

---

### **4. Usage**

For developers contributing to the project, development dependencies can now be installed easily:

```bash
# Clone the repository and navigate into the directory
git clone ...
cd commitlm

# Install the package in editable mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]
```

---

### **5. Breaking Changes**

*   **Dependency Removal**: The `pygithub` library is no longer included as a dependency. While unlikely, any external tools or scripts that relied on this package being transitively installed by `commitlm` will need to add it as a direct dependency.
